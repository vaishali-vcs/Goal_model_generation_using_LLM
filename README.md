# Goal Model Extraction from User Stories Using Large Language Models

This project consists of the code, the inputs, and outputs used in the paper titled "Goal Model Extraction from User Stories Using Large Language Models". 
This paper presents early researchproposing a technique using Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4, to automatically generate goal models from user stories. The approach
employs Iterative Prompt Engineering to guide the LLM in extracting intentional elements and generating XML representations using the Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL), visualized with the jUCMNav tool.

## How to install?
Following are steps to be followed:
1. Create a Virtual Environment.
2. Install Python 3.9, Pandas, and Tensorflow.
3. Clone this project.
4. Procure an OPENAI API Key.
5. Paste the key in API_Key.txt file without any double/single quotes.
6. Run the script - GPT4_goalmodel_generation.py

## How to tweak this project for your own uses?
Since this is a boilerplate version of the project, it has been tested only on User Stories as the input. I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to test it on other forms of requirements.
