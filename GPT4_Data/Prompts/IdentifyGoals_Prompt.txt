In this step you will identify both the implicit and explicit goals.
Each user story contains a critical element called goals. The goal represents the desired outcome or benefits the user wants, highlighting their needs and motivations.
There are two kinds of goals. Behavioral goals describe intended behavior of a system, and Soft-Goals are often related to non-functional requirements.
For the user stories, first list all the goals, soft-goals and resources needed to achieve them as a bulleted list. Then refine the goal model that you generated in the first response.
Remember that your response must be in the format delimited by triple back ticks.
