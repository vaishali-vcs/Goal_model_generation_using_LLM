In this step you have to identify Decomposition Links. Graphically, a decomposition link connects a node with its sub-components.
It provide the ability to define what other elements need to be achieved or available in order for a task to perform.
A Task Decomposition Structure shows the essential components of a task, which include subtasks that must be performed, subgoals that must be achieved, resources that must be accessible, and softgoals that must be satisfied.
For the goal model that you generated in the first response, refine the goal model by adding Decomposition relationships.
Remember that your response must be in the format delimited by triple back ticks.
